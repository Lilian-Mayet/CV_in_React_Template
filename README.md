## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your system (v18.x or higher recommended).
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lilian-Mayet/CV_in_React_Template.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```


2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running Locally

To start the development server and view the website locally:

Using npm:
npm start
Or using yarn:
yarn start


This will open the project in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
üõ†Ô∏è Customization
This template is designed to be easily customized to fit your personal brand and content.
1. Update Your Information (src/data.js)
The most important step is to update your personal information, experiences, skills, and projects. All this data is centralized in the src/data.js file.
Open src/data.js.
Modify the JavaScript objects:
profile: Your name, title, location, and profile picture path.
contactInfo: Your email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, Malt (or other platform) links.
about: Your summary and key points about yourself.
experiences: Your professional and associative experiences.
skills: Your technical, soft, and language skills. Add or remove categories as needed.
projects: Your personal and professional projects. Ensure you update image paths.
education: Your educational background.
Images: Place your images (profile picture, project images, etc.) in the src/assets/ folder (or create subfolders like src/assets/projects/). Then, import them at the top of src/data.js and use the imported variable in your data objects:
// At the top of src/data.js
import myProfilePic from './assets/my-profile.jpg';
import projectOneImage from './assets/projects/project-one.png';

// Example usage
export const profile = {
  image: myProfilePic,
  // ...
};

export const projects = [
  {
    id: 'proj-1',
    imageUrl: projectOneImage,
    // ...
  }
];


2. Styling (CSS)
Global Styles: Modify src/App.css for global styles, CSS variables (colors, fonts), and base element styling.
Component Styles: Each component in src/components/ has its own corresponding CSS file (e.g., src/components/Navbar.css). Modify these files to change the appearance of specific sections.
Favicon: Replace the favicon files in the public/ directory and update the links in public/index.html. Use a favicon generator for best results.


üèóÔ∏è Building for Production
To create an optimized build of your website for deployment:
Using npm:
npm run build
Or using yarn:
yarn build

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
The build (or dist) folder is what you need to deploy.
Recommended Host: Cloudflare Pages
Cloudflare Pages is an excellent, free, and fast platform for hosting static sites and frontend applications like this React portfolio.
Steps to deploy on Cloudflare Pages:
Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
Go to your Cloudflare dashboard.
Navigate to Workers & Pages -> Create application -> Pages -> Connect to Git.
Select your Git provider and the repository for this project.
In the "Set up builds and deployments" step:
Framework preset: Select "React" (or "Create React App" / "Vite" if available).
Build command:
If using npm: npm run build
If using yarn: yarn build
Build output directory:
/build (This is the default for Create React App)
/dist (This is the default for Vite)
Environment Variables (Optional): If you encountered ESLint errors during the build due to CI=true treating warnings as errors, you can add an environment variable:
Variable name: CI
Value: false
(However, it's better to fix the linting warnings in your code if possible.)
Click Save and Deploy.
Cloudflare Pages will then build your project and deploy it. You'll get a *.pages.dev subdomain, and you can also easily add custom domains.
Other Hosting Options
You can also deploy the build folder to other static site hosting services like:
Netlify
Vercel
GitHub Pages
AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.
The process will be similar: connect your Git repository or manually upload the contents of the build folder.
